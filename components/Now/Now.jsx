                                before I merge code. It takes in count also the

                                to be as much professional as I can.

                                begginers. I&apos;ve ended up with this one and
                                I&apos;m enjoying it a lot.

                                many opportunities to work on the backend side.
                                Normally I&apos;m more focused on the frontend
                                logic.
